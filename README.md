# CSED342(Artificial Intelligence)

## Objective
This course covers a broad range of AI-related topics at a fast pace including  machine learning, search algorithms, Markov decision process, games, constraint satisfaction problem, graphical models, and logic.\
This course focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts and principles on each topic.\
Accordingly, programming assignments will be implementing the core ideas with native python rather than blindly using AI libraries or tools.
